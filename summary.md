#  Summary of What I Learned

**Sorry for being late!**  
  I'm so sorry this is late. I made a mistake before-
  I created my own repository and even submitted a pull request there.
  But nobody was there to approve it!
  It felt like watinig for someone to answer an empty phone call.

## What I Learned

### I learned how to create a repository on GitHub.
### I practiced how to add files and commit changes.
### I understand the basic concept of pull requests.

### I'm still unsure about how to do a pull a request, and I will do it few minutes later.
### I need more practice with brahcing and mergin.
